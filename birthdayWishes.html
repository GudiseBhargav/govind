       <p><strong>Dear Govind Sir,</strong></p>

      <p>Wishing you a very Happy Birthday! 🎂🥳 On this special occasion, I want to take a moment not just to celebrate your day, but also to express my heartfelt gratitude for everything you have been to me  as a mentor, a guide, a friend, and a brother. 🙏👬</p>

      <p>I still remember the days at our previous center when you were my reporting manager (CAH). 🏢 From the very beginning, you created such a positive 🌟 and free environment for me to work in. While many managers maintain a professional distance, you chose a different path. You treated me with respect and friendliness, always encouraging me to speak freely, take decisions, and grow 📈. That kind of support is rare, and I’ll always be thankful for it. 🙌</p>

      <p>Our bond wasn’t limited to work. We enjoyed every free moment  from playing cricket 🏏 and badminton 🏸 to having long conversations 💬 and sharing laughter 😂 after tiring days. Those simple yet meaningful moments made our time there unforgettable. When we were transferred, I truly felt the absence of that comfort and companionship. 😔</p>

      <p>But destiny had its own plans ✨. We met again  not as manager and subordinate, but as colleagues and roommates 🏠. And still, your nature remained the same  always supportive, always kind. You never showed authority or ego. Instead, you welcomed me once again into your life like a true friend 🤝. I feel genuinely lucky 🍀 to share not only the same workplace but also the same roof with someone like you.</p>

      <p>Even in this new place, your presence continues to inspire me every single day 🌄. You have taught me more than I can put into words that how to teach effectively 👨‍🏫, how to build a connection with students 👥, how to gain their respect and trust 🙇‍♂️, and how to stay calm and grounded in every situation 🧘. These lessons are not just about work, they are life lessons, and I carry them with me always. 💡</p>

      <p>On a personal level too, you have been there for me like a brother 👨‍👦. From helping me in daily life 🍲, cooking for me, guiding me through challenges 🧭, to simply being there when I needed someone to talk to 🗣️ . you’ve played a role that goes far beyond that of a colleague. Your kindness, patience, and understanding make you a person who brings comfort to everyone around you. 💖</p>

      <p>What makes me respect you even more is your life journey 🛤️. I have seen the strength in you that comes from real struggles and hardships 💪. The way you have faced difficulties in life, especially in your student days 📚, and still rose to this position, is truly admirable 🏅. It’s not just inspiring , it’s humbling. I don’t think many people could have walked the path you did and come out with such positivity and humility. That story alone makes you someone to look up to. 🙇</p>

      <p>Everyone who knows you  whether professionally or personally  says the same: “He is a good human being.” 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 And I completely agree. You are not only liked, you are respected. And that’s something earned only by character, not by position. 👏</p>

      <p>I feel blessed 🙏 to have this bond with you. And I truly hope it remains the same forever  no matter where life takes us or what paths we follow 🚶‍♂️. You are not just a colleague to me. You are family my <bold>BIG BROTHER</bold>. ❤️</p>

      <p><strong>Once again, Happy Birthday, Govind Sir! 🎉🎂</strong><br>
      May this year bring you everything you deserve — happiness 😊, peace ☮️, good health 🏥, and more success 🏆 in both personal and professional life. Enjoy your day to the fullest! 🎈</p>

      <p>With deep respect, gratitude, and affection,<br>
      <strong>Bhargav Chandu</strong></p>
